### Hi there <a href="https://trud.ca/"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="5%"></a> I'm Luc Trudeau

🧪 This is where I experiment with video compression research.

Some of it becomes open-source tools.

### About me

I’m a Canadian🇨🇦 video compression researcher and independent consultant.  
I’ve worked on AV1, contributed to dav1d, and spent years thinking about how to make codecs faster, simpler, and better.

I care about:
- Efficient compression algorithms
- Practical implementations
- Bridging research and production systems

### What I work on

- AV1 / AV2 research and optimization  
- Objective quality metrics
- Fast algorithms for encoding and decoding  
- Experimental learned image/video compression  

Most projects here start as research experiments.  
Some grow into production-ready tools.
